								<p style="text-align:justify;"><sup>19th October 2025</sup>
								I think my first encounter with someone's suicide was in November 2024, when one of my best friends... <br>
								Thankfully they are alive to this day. That&nbsp;terrible time back then is still when I&nbsp;hit the wall of realization though. Most&nbsp;people didn't care. Most&nbsp;people didn't care at all or they cared just a tiny 
								bit. I&nbsp;was literally going to follow with my own suicide cause I&nbsp;couldn't live with it (I&nbsp;would be long dead if not the news that this friend is alive). Some&nbsp;reactions were like "oh. Well, anyways 
								<i>talks about games/anime</i>". How&nbsp;dare they how dare they HOW DARE THEY<b> HOW DARE THEY???</b><br>
								I&nbsp;think it's obvious enough that I&nbsp;kinda stopped talking with them after this. Why&nbsp;would I&nbsp;be friends with people who don't care about a&nbsp;friend's life? I&nbsp;couldn't understand how a person can 
								react like that. And&nbsp;so I&nbsp;realized, were I&nbsp;to die, it&nbsp;wouldn't be any different. Probably&nbsp;less people would even care in the slightest considering that my friend was liked by everyone very much 
								and I'm not.<br>
								Wherever&nbsp;I&nbsp;went after that I&nbsp;would always notice this pattern. Some&nbsp;people who care and the majority that doesn't. Even&nbsp;the ones who cared forgot in a matter of days or a&nbsp;few weeks. 
								I&nbsp;started to despise those people. Despise their actions. When the Charlotte Fosgate situation happened however....<br>
								Caring is dead. If&nbsp;you die almost no one will give a&nbsp;fuck. Most&nbsp;of those who would, will forget you soon anyway. For&nbsp;some people your death might even be a&nbsp;blessing and a&nbsp;great joke 
								material. There's&nbsp;nothing else hidden under death. If&nbsp;you cross over to the other side, you'll just become a&nbsp;number here. A&nbsp;number, one small digit not worth any attention. After&nbsp;all who cares 
								about the 200001st person who died? We'll just round it up anyway and not pay respect to that one. Who&nbsp;will remember you from all the other people who committed suicide? Almost no one or literally no one. 
								Death&nbsp;is&nbsp;meaningless. As much as it hurts to say it, it changes nothing. You&nbsp;disappear, you don't stick around and you do not come back in any shape or form, you're forgotten. Your&nbsp;death is only 
								impacting the statistics really. Your&nbsp;existance is diminished to pure contribution to them, to&nbsp;numbers.<br>
								I&nbsp;have more experiences with suicide now sadly and it's what always happens. Maybe&nbsp;some individuals care but they are just a tiny few in this madness. If&nbsp;our death is meaningless, why do we often care 
								about others when we take this decision to disappear though? Why&nbsp;are we thinking about people who'll mostly forget us in a day?<br>
								I&nbsp;despise how this works. I&nbsp;hate it with every cell of my body. But&nbsp;I&nbsp;can't do anything. World&nbsp;is&nbsp;just&nbsp;cruel.</p>
								<p style="text-align:justify;"> Please don't take this as encouragement to die. There are better ways. If&nbsp;you feel bad or down, sad, please just contact someone you trust, or me. I'll&nbsp;try to help whenever 
								I&nbsp;have the time to. If&nbsp;you're reading this then you're obviously a&nbsp;close friend, cause I&nbsp;shared this site with only them. I&nbsp;want to help, so please give me a chance. Even if for the world you 
								might be just a number, for me you'll always and forever be something more.</p>
								
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/truth.jpg" alt="TRUTH:" /></span>
								<p style="text-align:justify;"><sup>17th October 2025</sup>
								Sometimes simple things get me thinking about some stuff. Recently finished the 1st route in "Orwell: Keeping an Eye On You" and I bought the sequel, 
								"Orwell: Ignorance is Strength", to continue the story of my first route. And in this game, there's a&nbsp;quote, at the very start. (I&nbsp;won't give any spoilers to the game). 
								One of the characters talks with someone over a phone and says: <br>
								<blockquote style="text-align:justify;">"Truth? See, I never had much regard for the Bible. But there's one remarkable, groundbreaking moment. Before being sentenced to death Jesus goes on and on about being 
								"a witness for the truth." But Pilate defies him with the simplest of all questions: "What is truth?" It is this particular question I've been pondering over for a very long time now.
								How much of the information ending up on our screens every single day has passed through so many other minds before, each one with their own bias and agenda. It is all cut down to size, proportioned, ready to be 
								consumed. And yet we greedily swallow it all in blissful ignorance. Because our hunger is unending. [...] There is only one thing about truth that is certain: Truth... is dead. [...]" </blockquote><br></p>
								<p style="text-align:justify;">Those words got me thinking. Thinking about truth. Now I can say with certainty. I&nbsp;believe that truth exists. There is always one and definite truth. However, honestly speaking, 
								reaching that truth is hard. Almost impossible. As humans, we are just incapable of learning it. To start of, we can't get to know every situation from every angle and perspective perfectly. Then, we also have 
								a&nbsp;problem with our very nature. We&nbsp;take things subjectively, we believe in what our mind tells us. I'm&nbsp;sure that some people might know how it works, but let's all imagine, that we live in a smaller city 
								where everyone knows each other. Someone falsely accused us of a serious crime. People around us will start looking at us differently instantly, as soon as they hear about said situation. Even if the judge, the court, police 
								find us not guilty, for the people around us we'll always be stained. It doesn't matter if the accusation was correct. Similar thing could happen in bigger cities as well, however there it wouldn't be as noticable. 
								Only the people you know, your circles will see you on a different light. Of course some might argue that not everyone is like that, but the fact is that most people won't look at you the same. <br>
								One of the reasons why death penalty is illegal in many countries is that people were sometimes found guilty of crimes they never committed (a lost life cannot be given back after all). The truth doesn't always lie 
								when we think it does. Our perception of reality is stained. We can't know everything about any given situation and we cannot discard our subjective way of thinking completely. One person I talked with told me that for 
								them the truth is only what our perception says, but I find this thinking wrong. Imagine if your best friend was killed by someone, but the murderer made it look like a suicide flawlessly. To you and the police and whoever 
								might see the scene, it was suicide. But the truth is that it was homicide. Perception doesn't define truth, perception just gives partial information that we can often blindly take as truth.</p>
								<p style="text-align:justify;">But does it all mean that truth is just beyond us and we won't ever reach it? That we should just give up? No, not at all. Even if truth is hard to find, I still believe we should strive for 
								it. Let's&nbsp;say you have problems with your partner. Instead of just narrow-mindedly reaching a conclusion yourself, you should ask said partner for their perspective and if the subject allows it, talk about it with your 
								trusted friends. Only&nbsp;them when you have a broader image in mind should you think about it for real. That's not a perfect solution, but it's one that puts you closer to the real truth.</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/bro.jpg" alt="BRO:" /></span>
								<p style="text-align:justify;">If someone asked me to name a 3 letter word that annoys me the most, I'd without any hesitation spit out "bro".<br>
								My hate towards this word goes beyond comprehension. <b>I despise it.</b> And it's not the only one like that which I can't stand.<br>
								"Bro", "man", "guys"... all of them can <b>burn and rot away.</b> Seeing someone use any of them towards me just makes me lose my temper. The word's themselves wouldn't bother me. But they do when they are directed at me. Most of the time it's just the fault of the one who uses them. Why do boys think that calling people like that is cool? Why do they have to do it all the time? And most importantly... WHY CAN'T THEY JUST UNDERSTAND AND STOP USING THEM TOWARDS ME WHEN I ASK THEM TO?<br>
								One time when some boy called me "bro" (and just know, it was not the first time he did i. I already asked him not to do it before) I responded with "I'm a girl". And guess what he said to that. Try to guess. He said that he doesn't discriminate and that girls are "bros" too, he also said that "bro" is universal... NO IT'S FUCKING NOT. FUCK THAT PERSON.<br>
								Not once, not twice, but MULTIPLE times have I asked people I know, my friends even, to not call me "bro", but they just can't fucking listen. They say that okay, they won't, but then they start doing again after like an hour...</p>
								<p style="text-align:justify;"> No idea how to call me instead? You can just say "girl". That's all, it's that simple. And no, it's not that hard to say this instead. <b>It shouldn't be a problem to switch after I&nbsp;ask you to, especially if I&nbsp;ask you more than once...</b></p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/story.jpg" alt="STORY:" /></span>
								<p style="text-align:justify;">Once upon a time, a few hours ago, a tall boy of a short height was walking with a 6yo grandma on a meadow covered in asphalt.
								It was Thursday, and as befits the beginning of the week, the boy was walking lying on the ground in a squatting position while crawling to the plumbing store for flour, but they only had green oranges.
								He took them to his uncle, with whom he went by car on a bike to the pool to run on hands with weights in the mountains.
								After coming back, the uncle comes in the elevator, and here are the stairs.
								He pushes the button and walks upwards.
								There awaited a naked person with clothes on, barefoot in shoes and with a fire extinguisher, he asked if they want to go shopping at a cinema.
								It was evening, around 8:00 AM after noon, so they decided to drink some sandwiches and eat some still water with sparkles.
								After an insatiable meal, they were very full, so they continued eating, because they were hungry.
								On their way they met a little tall girl, with squared triangles in the shape of circles on her back, so they didn't ask her 'what happened?', and she didn't answer that her grandpa has green sandals.
								They were shocked after seeing this message and started shouting with all their might quietly to not disturb the people around, as it was a library on a stadium, where a beating each other with TV cables match was taking place, in which a horde of one person was participating, and this person was sitting on a wooden stone made out of aluminum sunbathing in the shadow.
								At the same moment, 3 days later, a burning cold came.
								The boy run to the lake, where on the shore he found 3 boats - one normal, second was only a half, and the 3rd one never existed.
								He crawled on his eyelashes to the third one and flew to a deserted island, where there was a village of Hungarian Indians from north-south Africa.
								He climbed a palm tree, slipped and fell from an apple tree to a willow tree.
								The owner of said pine tree comes and says 'get down from this poplar, because it's my oak'
								The boy came down, picked up the coconuts and went to the town square to sell some carrots.
								Then the deaf man heard the mute say that the blind girl had seen the snaggle-toothed man bite off the hair of the bald woman who was running with the paralyzed guy.
								So he ran after him, turned right and got lost, but knowing where he was, he came back home and peed out shit, then he jumped out of the window to sleep.
								He accidentally kicked himself in the middle knee with his third armpit.
								He fell onto the roof of the same garage he had jumped from an hour ago.
								Not&nbsp;knowing what to do, he confidently continued walking along the same sidewalk.</p>
